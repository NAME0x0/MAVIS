- Script hot-reloading capability

**Remaining Work:**
- Complete API implementation for some modules
- More extensive testing

### 4. Resource Monitoring ✅ **85% Complete**

**Strengths:**
- Multi-threaded monitoring system
- CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring
- Windows PDH integration
- Configurable monitoring intervals

**Remaining Work:**
- GUI integration for displaying metrics
- Performance optimization

### 5. Shell Replacement ⚠️ **40% Complete**

**Current State:**
- `ShellManager` structure exists
- Placeholder functions for registration/unregistration
- Basic crash detection framework
- Safe mode detection stub

**Critical Gaps:**
- No actual Windows registry manipulation
- Shell Launcher v2 API integration missing
- Crash threshold and recovery logic incomplete
- Manual override functionality not implemented

**Required for MVP:**
- Complete Windows shell registration mechanism
- Implement crash detection and auto-recovery
- Add Safe Mode detection using Windows APIs
- Manual override key combination handling

### 6. GUI Framework ⚠️ **30% Complete**

**Current State:**
- Basic `imgui-rs` integration structure
- Winit window creation placeholder
- GUI state management framework
- Module organization for widgets and rendering

**Critical Gaps:**
- No Direct2D rendering implementation
- ImGui platform integration incomplete
- No actual UI components rendered
- Widget system not functional

**Required for MVP:**
- Complete Direct2D rendering backend (with GDI fallback)
- Implement basic ImGui platform integration
- Create functional taskbar component
- Basic window management UI

### 7. Terminal Subsystem ⚠️ **50% Complete**

**Current State:**
- ConPTY session creation and management
- Output reading thread implementation
- Basic terminal state structure
- Integration points with GUI defined

**Critical Gaps:**
- No LF (file manager) integration
- ANSI escape sequence parsing missing
- Input handling not implemented
- Terminal UI rendering incomplete

**Required for MVP:**
- Complete LF integration within ConPTY
- Implement ANSI parsing and rendering
- Add terminal input/output UI components
- File preview system integration

## Phase 1 MVP Requirements Status

According to README.md Section 13, Phase 1 MVP requires:

| Requirement | Status | Completion |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Stable Shell Replacement | ❌ Not Complete | 40% |
| Basic ImGui GUI Framework with Direct2D | ❌ Not Complete | 30% |
| Functional ConPTY Terminal Integration | ⚠️ Partial | 50% |
| LF Integration within Terminal | ❌ Not Started | 10% |
| Initial Taskbar Implementation | ❌ Not Started | 5% |

## Critical Blockers for MVP

### 1. **Build System Issues**
- Project doesn't compile due to Linux fontconfig dependencies
- Need Windows-specific build configuration
- Cross-platform dependency resolution required

### 2. **GUI Rendering Backend**
- Direct2D integration completely missing
- No actual visual components rendered
- ImGui platform integration incomplete

### 3. **Windows Shell Integration**
- Core shell replacement functionality not implemented
- Registry manipulation missing
- Windows API integration incomplete

### 4. **Terminal Functionality**
- LF file manager integration missing
- Terminal rendering not implemented
- Input/output handling incomplete

## Recommendations for Reaching MVP

### Immediate Priorities (Critical Path)

1. **Fix Build System** (1-2 days)
   - Remove Linux dependencies or make them optional
   - Configure Windows-specific build targets
   - Ensure project compiles on Windows

2. **Implement Basic GUI Rendering** (1-2 weeks)
   - Complete Direct2D backend implementation
   - Add basic ImGui platform integration
   - Create minimal functional UI

3. **Complete Shell Registration** (1 week)
   - Implement Windows registry manipulation
   - Add Shell Launcher v2 API integration
   - Complete crash detection logic

4. **Basic Terminal Functionality** (1 week)
   - Integrate LF file manager
   - Implement basic terminal rendering
   - Add input/output handling

### Secondary Priorities

5. **Taskbar Implementation** (1 week)
   - Basic window management
   - System tray integration
   - Application launcher

6. **Testing and Polish** (1 week)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Bug fixes and optimization
   - Documentation updates

## Estimated Timeline to MVP

**Total Estimated Time:** 6-8 weeks of focused development

- **Critical Path Items:** 4-5 weeks
- **Secondary Features:** 2-3 weeks  
- **Testing and Polish:** 1-2 weeks

## Strengths to Build Upon

1. **Excellent Architecture:** Well-designed modular system
2. **Comprehensive Configuration:** Sophisticated config and scripting
3. **Professional Documentation:** Detailed specifications and plans
4. **Resource Monitoring:** Robust monitoring system ready for integration
5. **Error Handling:** Good Rust practices with proper error types

## Conclusion

MAVIS has a solid foundation with excellent architectural decisions and comprehensive planning. The core infrastructure is largely complete, but significant work remains in GUI rendering, Windows integration, and terminal functionality. With focused effort on the critical path items, the project could reach MVP status within 6-8 weeks.

The project demonstrates strong potential and, once the rendering and integration components are complete, should provide a robust foundation for the advanced shell environment envisioned in the specification.
